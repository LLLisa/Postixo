A simple Postgresql database viewer for linux, specifically debian and redhat
distros. Currently works only with databases with 'USER' set to 'all' and
'METHOD' set to 'trust'. Developed over a week as a Stackathon projectwhile
attending Full Stack Acedemy. My first solo project to reach this level of
sophistication!

In the Postico.exe folder, you will find downloads for debian and redhat builds.

Enjoy!
